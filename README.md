# Assignment 2
The user audience for this website is catered to users who wants convenience while using the internet to search for information. Since searching for different information on different websites takes time and effort, the purpose of this website is to give users convenience and be a time-saver by allowing users to check the weather forecast, PSI values, MRT Map and explore Google Maps all in one website.

The most appreciated value would likely be the time-saving factor, since the website has conveniently consolidated all the information, it allows the user to spend the extra free time to do other things. For users who have a preference for colour schemes, the website also caters to users by offering both light and dark mode.
## Design Process
As mentioned previously, this website is catered to users who would like to save time and have convenience when searching for information on the internet. 

The best way to achieve this is to develop and all in one website that would be designed to be simple, modern and aesthetically pleasing while containing essential pages. 

With that said, since one consolidated website cannot possibly contain every information, I had to think of what are the important pages and commonly searched informations I should include for my website. By thinking through the perspective of what a daily user would like to see, I came up with Home, Google Maps, MRT Map, Weather and a Contact page. 
### User stories
Personally as a user, I would like to have the information I need consolidated in one website with little clicks as much as possible. I would prefer this than manually searching for different information on different websites, since it would mean lesser time and effort spent on searching information on the internet.
### Colour Schemes
Fitting with current trends and standard, this website offers two colour schemes for users to choose from. Light mode mostly contains light-coloured elements which are ideal for use in bright environment. While dark mode mostly contains dark-coloured element which are ideal and recommended for use in dark environment.
### Uniformity and Simplicity
As you navigate through the different pages, you would notice that there is strong uniformity in its design language and layout. Thinking from the perspective of an average user, it would be easier and more comfortable to navigate since all pages shares most of the same layout. Doing so also helps to cut down on development time, as I could simply reuse the shell and modify accordingly to the page's requirements.
### One cancelled idea
One idea that was struck off was the ability for users to input their to-do-list into a list that would have been displayed in a table format. It was struck off as having too many pages seemed too clustered and would certainly prolong the development time as well.
