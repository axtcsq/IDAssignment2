# Assignment 2
The user audience for this website is catered to users who wants convenience while using the internet to search for information. Since searching for different information on different websites takes time and effort, the purpose of this website is to give users convenience and be a time-saver by allowing users to check the weather forecast, PSI values, and explore maps all in one website.

The most appreciated value would likely be the time-saving factor, since the website has conveniently consolidated all the information, it allows the user to spend the extra free time to do other things. For users who have a preference for colour schemes, the website also caters to users by offering both light and dark mode.

## Design Process
For this assignment, this website has been designed to be simple, modern and aesthetically pleasing from the start. Personally as a user, I would like to have the information I need consolidated in one website with little clicks as much as possible. 

I would prefer this than manually searching for different information on different websites, since it would mean lesser time and effort spent on searching information on the internet.

With that said, since one consolidated website cannot possibly contain every information, I had to think of what are the important pages and commonly searched informations I should include for my website. By thinking through the perspective of what a daily user would like to see, I came up with Home, Google Maps, MRT Map, Weather and a Contact page. 

One idea that was struck off was the ability for users to input their to-do-list into a list that would have been displayed in a table format. It was struck off as it seemed out of place, since the website's main aim is to consolidate and display information. The idea of having too many pages also seemed too clustered and it would certainly prolong the development time as well.
